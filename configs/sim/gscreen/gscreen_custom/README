tester.ini
  -Tester is used to load a GLADE file without
   initializing anything beyond the window.
   The glade file must be called tester.glade
   The toplevel window must be called window1
   tester_handler.py is also a template of a 
   handler file for adding python code for
   more sophisticated customizations.
   If you run this without adding a GLADE
   file to the folder, it will load a default
   gscreen file.
